# EDA_Machinelearning_project-Python
I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and various libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to gain insights from the data. Additionally, I utilised machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier. 
The project showcases data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insightful visualizations.
